**Sub-questions**

**Historical Context:**

- **How did source code management practices evolve before Git?**

Before the advent of Git, source code management (SCM) practices evolved through several stages, with different version control systems (VCS) reflecting the needs and technological advancements of their times.

Early Practices

1. Manual Versioning:
    - File Copies: Developers manually copied files to create versions, often appending dates or version numbers to filenames.
    - Challenges: This method was error-prone, hard to manage, and did not scale well with larger teams or projects.

Early Version Control Systems

1. Source Code Control System (SCCS) (1972):
    - Introduction of Version Control: SCCS, developed by Bell Labs, was one of the first VCS tools, enabling basic versioning and history tracking of individual files.
    - Limitations: SCCS was primarily designed for single-user environments and did not support collaborative workflows well.
2. Revision Control System (RCS) (1982):
    - Improvements Over SCCS: RCS introduced better versioning capabilities, allowing for the storage of revisions and differences between files.
    - File-Based System: Like SCCS, RCS worked on a per-file basis and did not support project-wide versioning.

Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

1. Concurrent Versions System (CVS) (1986):
    - Collaborative Development: CVS introduced the concept of a centralized repository, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project and merge their changes.
    - Branching and Tagging: CVS supported basic branching and tagging, though merging branches was often cumbersome.
    - Challenges: CVS had issues with handling binary files and its merging capabilities were limited, often leading to conflicts.
2. Apache Subversion (SVN) (2000):
    - Enhanced Features: SVN was designed to address the shortcomings of CVS. It offered better support for binary files, improved branching and merging, and atomic commits.
    - Centralized Model: Like CVS, SVN used a centralized repository model, requiring a constant connection to the server for most operations.
    - Widely Adopted: SVN became popular in the early 2000s and was widely used in both open-source and commercial projects.

Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

1. BitKeeper (1998):
    - Distributed Nature: BitKeeper was one of the first DVCS tools, allowing developers to have local copies of the repository and perform version control operations without needing constant access to a central server.
    - Controversy: BitKeeper was initially proprietary, and its use in the development of the Linux kernel led to some controversy, ultimately driving the development of Git.

The Rise of Git (2005)

1. Git (2005):
    - Linux Kernel Development: Git was created by Linus Torvalds for managing the Linux kernel’s development, addressing the shortcomings of previous systems.
    - Distributed and Efficient: Git combined the advantages of DVCS (local repositories, branching and merging, and speed) with robust features for collaboration.
    - Wide Adoption: Git’s performance, flexibility, and strong community support led to its rapid adoption across the software development industry.

- **What were the limitations of previous version control systems (VCS) that Git aimed to address?**

1\. Centralized vs. Distributed Model

Limitation: Centralized VCS like CVS and SVN required a central server for most operations. This meant that developers needed a constant connection to the server to perform version control tasks such as commits, updates, and branching. This centralization created a single point of failure and could slow down operations.

Git's Solution: Git is a distributed VCS, where every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its entire history. This allows for:

- Offline Work: Developers can commit, create branches, and explore history offline.
- Redundancy and Backups: Each clone of the repository serves as a backup, reducing the risk of data loss.
- Performance: Local operations are faster because they do not require communication with a central server.

2\. Branching and Merging

Limitation: In centralized systems like CVS and SVN, branching and merging were often resource-intensive and slow. Merging could be cumbersome and error-prone, leading to frequent conflicts and integration challenges.

Git's Solution: Git provides lightweight, fast, and flexible branching and merging. Key features include:

- Efficient Branch Creation: Creating and switching branches in Git is quick and easy.
- Non-Linear Development: Git supports a non-linear development workflow, allowing multiple branches to exist concurrently and merge seamlessly.
